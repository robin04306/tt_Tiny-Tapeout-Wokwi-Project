## How it works

Wokwi project using a D flip flop to display "EFAB" on the 7 segment display

## How to test

How to Test the Design
Step 1: Simulate in Wokwi
Open the Project in Wokwi:

Find the wokwi_id in the info.yaml file of this repository.
Go to Wokwi.com and paste the project ID into the URL (e.g., https://wokwi.com/projects/your_wokwi_id).
Run the Simulation:

Once the project is open in Wokwi, press the play button to start the simulation.
Observe the 7-segment display. It should sequentially show the characters "E", "F", "A", and "B".
Step 2: Build and Test Locally
Clone the Repository:

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Required Tools:

Follow the instructions in the Tiny Tapeout documentation to set up your local environment.
Run the Simulation Locally:

Use the provided scripts or commands in the repository to simulate the design locally. Refer to the Tiny Tapeout documentation for specific commands and tools.
Step 3: Verify and Submit
Verify the Design:

Ensure that the design behaves as expected and meets the project specifications.
Submit to Tiny Tapeout:

If you're satisfied with the simulation, you can submit your design to the next Tiny Tapeout shuttle using the Tiny Tapeout submission tool.
